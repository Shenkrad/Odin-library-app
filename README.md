# 📚 Odin Library App

A simple library app built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of [The Odin Project’s JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-library).  
The goal of this exercise is to practice **object constructors, prototypes, and DOM manipulation** by building a small web app that allows users to manage a personal book collection.
